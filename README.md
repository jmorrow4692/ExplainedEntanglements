Here is code verifying the computations and theorems of the manuscript

                      ``TOWARDS A CLASSIFICATION OF ENTANGLEMENTS OF GALOIS REPRESENTATIONS ATTACHED TO ELLIPTIC CURVES"

                                   By Harris B. Daniels, Alvaro Lozano-Robledo, and Jackson S. Morrow
                                   
There is one folder in this Github, called Code, which contains a .zip file for the code verifying the claims in this paper. 

Once the .zip file is unzipped, there will be two folders. 

The first, AuxillaryFiles, contains the functions we need for the computations, and the second, Computations, contains the computations for the paper.
