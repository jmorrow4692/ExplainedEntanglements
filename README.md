Here is code verifying the computations and theorems of the manuscript

There is one folder in this Github, called Code, which contains a .zip file for the code verifying the claims in this paper. 

Once the .zip file is unzip, there will be two folders. The first, AuxillaryFiles, contains the functions we need for the computations, and the second, Computations, contains the computations for the paper.
